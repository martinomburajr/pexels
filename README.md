# pexels
An application that pulls images from [Pexels][1] and adds them as your background photo. 

## Introduction
The pexels application is written entirely in [Golang][2] and currently runs as a binary that acts as a HTTP server. This server accepts requests that perform actions such as: 

    1. Fetching New Photos: _Given a Pexel Image ID_
    2. Fetching Random Photos: 
    3. Automatically Setting a Downloaded Image as a backdrop.
  
## Contributions
Play around with the application and create some issues if you encounter a bug, or would like to see something added.

#### Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with Pexels, and this is not their Official application. I just thought it would be a fun little experiment.
